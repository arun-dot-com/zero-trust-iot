# Zero trust Module for IoT devices in  ns-3
The modules developed within this Zero Trust IoT library for ns-3 work in close coordination to form a comprehensive, layered security architecture that emulates the real-world enforcement of Zero Trust principles in constrained, distributed environments like the Internet of Things (IoT). Each module addresses a distinct facet of Zero Trust—identity, policy enforcement, encryption, session security, and observability—but their true strength lies in how they interact to build a coherent and enforceable trust boundary around every node and communication event within the network.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the ns-3 mainline code

    ```bash
    git clone -b ns-3.45 https://gitlab.com/nsnam/ns-3-dev.git
    ```
2. Change into the contrib directory

    ```bash
    cd contrib
    ```
3. Clone the Zero Trust Simulation Module

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/the-ns3-programmer/zero-trust-iot.git
    ```
4. Configure ns-3 and build it. Ensure the following [cryptopp](https://github.com/weidai11/cryptopp) is installed:

    ```bash
    ./ns3 configure --enable-examples --enable-qpp --enable-crypto
    ```

    ```bash
    ./ns3 build
    ```
5. Run the examples by copying it to the scratch folder.
